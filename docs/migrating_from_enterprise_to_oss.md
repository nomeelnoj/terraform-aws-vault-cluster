# Migrating from Vault Enterprise to OSS

It is possible to migrate from Vault Enterprise to OSS. Since this module supports both, it made sense to include a write-up.

As long as the proper pre-requisites are followed to remove any dependency on enterprise-only features, the migration is possible.

A full explanation of how to complete this migration can be found at <https://github.com/nomeelnoj/vault-enterprise-to-oss>
